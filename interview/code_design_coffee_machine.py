# Design a Coffee Machine

# It will be serving some beverages.

# Each beverage will be made using some ingredients.

# Assume time to prepare a beverage is the same for all cases.

# The quantity of ingredients used for each beverage can vary. Also, the same ingredient (ex: water) can be used for multiple beverages.

# There would be N ( N is an integer ) outlet from which beverages can be served.
# Maximum N beverages can be served in parallel.

# Any beverage can be served only if all the ingredients are available in terms of quantity.

# There would be an indicator that would show which all ingredients are running low. We need some methods to refill them.

# Please provide functional integration test cases for maximum coverage.
